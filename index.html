Also, evaluation was described as an official channel through which students can communicate with the faculty. Some participated in CTE for more personal reasons, for example expressing their thoughts on the curriculum for the year, or because they regarded the CTE as an opportunity to evaluate their learning.
<div>Some students held a reserved attitude to evaluations. Some were uncertain whether their input was noticed given the large amount of student feedback the faculty handles in a year.

The source of discrepancy appeared to come from the teaching format, as the current medical curriculum involves new formats such as micromodules and flipped classrooms. The CTE form, on the other hand, is based on a "lecture and tutorial" format. Students reported this as a reason of their difficulties in filling out evaluation forms, particularly on aspects such as teaching format and teaching styles of individual teachers. Students also stated that questions such as language used, IT resources and library resources were not relevant to their learning.

</span><span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Students also wished to write qualitative explanations after making their choices on Likert scales. As questions are based on Likert scales, students were unable to describe their opinion in detail. Students suggested including more free input in the evaluation forms, for example short answer questions, so that they can write evaluations in their own words. Students saw that such questions may minimize the difference between student opinion and CTE results.</span></div></div>

                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pr-lg-4 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">A majority of interviewees stated the importance of student-faculty communication. They viewed CTE as a major channel of collecting student feedback, and saw the difficulties involved in addressing every piece of feedback obtained through this route. Alternative means of evaluation were discussed, including direct email contact with course coordinators, unofficial evaluations held by class representatives, and small group discussions with academic advisors. 
<div>
</div><div>Students from year 1 have mentioned academic advisors as an effective channel of communication with the faculty. Advisors have discussed with students their views on courses and alternative teaching activities, for example micromodules and flipped classrooms. Likewise, students preferred small group discussions among their academic advisory group. They found it easier to discuss their opinion in a small group setting, where the atmosphere was perceived as less judgmental.

                <div>
<span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Students of senior years, who were not under the new academic advisory system, mentioned unofficial feedback collection by class representatives as a favorable alternative to CTEs. The questions on the online form set up by class representatives were said to be in line with the medical curriculum. Students also found evaluations by class representatives beneficial to their anonymity.&nbsp;</span></div><div>
</div><div>In general, students found reassurance when results from CTEs were addressed in public by course coordinators. Students who recalled such events were willing to write more on CTEs as they felt that course coordinators received the CTE results. Students also suggested releasing CTE results to students so that students can see their input being processed by the faculty.
